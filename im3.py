# Write a program that prints Hello world 












# The class im3 is a 3D image measurement class that estimates 3D movement 
# of points of interests (POIs) and deformation of regions (ROIs) from 
# photos taken by multiple cameras. 
# The major features include the following:
# 1. Multiple camera synchronization: The class can synchronize multiple
#    cameras by estimating the time offset between the cameras.
# 2. Multiple camera stereo triangulation: The class can estimate the 3D
#    position of POIs by stereo triangulation from multiple cameras.
# 3. 
# 4.

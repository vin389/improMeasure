Write a tkinter GUI part of code. This is a program with Tkinter GUI.
In GUI window, use grid for layout.
In grid row 0, at left side, there is a button titled 'Working directory ...', 
and is named bt_workDir, 
right side is a text entry, named tx_workDir, that allows user to key-in. 
If user clicks button bt_workDir, a tk file dialog pops up for user to select a directory.
If user does not cancel the file dialog, the selected directory path is displayed at tx_workDir. 
If mouse hovers over tx_workDir, a tooltip is temporarily displayed, with text of "Select working directory or enter it here"
